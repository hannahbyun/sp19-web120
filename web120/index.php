 <p id="gap">I'm a musician and do some performances.<br>
 Besides making music I'm learning coding, since I feel it's very critical to survive in this technologically modern era. I was facinated by using css to make webpages fancy, so it'd be great if I master this skill. I hope finishing this program successfully, so I can support my family with a job realated to the web development.</p>
